- **Memory**: Minimal
- **Results**: Binary (found/not found)
- **Setup**: Instant, no indexing

## Practical Guidelines

### ‚úÖ Search Patterns That Work Well

**Effective queries (tested):**
- Specific features: "email validation in registration form" ‚úì
- Mixed concepts: "SAML authentication" ‚úì
- Technical concepts: "anti-flood protection" (finds rate limiting)
- Business logic: Domain-specific terminology often performs better

**Less effective queries:**
- Too generic: "validation" (many low-score results)
- Unrelated terms: "banana apple orange" (scores < 0.45)
- Wrong project name: Clear error message provided

### ‚úÖ Use Semantic Search When

1. **Exploring unfamiliar codebases**
   - "How does error handling work?"
   - "Where is the caching implemented?"

2. **Finding business features**
   - "Customer notification system"
   - "Invoice generation logic"

3. **Understanding implementations**
   ```bash
   # Get surrounding context
   mcp__csharp-search__search_with_context --query "validation logic" --contextLines 15
   ```

4. **Discovering related code**
   ```bash
   # Find multiple related concepts
   mcp__csharp-search__batch_search --queries "SAML,OAuth,JWT,authentication"
   ```

### ‚úÖ Use Traditional Tools When

1. **Needing complete coverage**
   - Security audits
   - Refactoring (find ALL usages)
   - Dependency analysis

2. **Working with known patterns**
   - Finding all async methods
   - Locating specific attributes
   - File naming conventions

3. **Performance matters**
   - Large codebases
   - Frequent searches
   - CI/CD pipelines

## Search Strategy Decision Tree

```
Need to understand a feature?
‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Start with batch_search (3-5 related concepts)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Found interesting results? ‚Üí search_with_context for details
‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Know exactly what you want?
    ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Use search_project with specific query
    ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Traditional tools (grep/glob)
```

## Advanced Search Strategies

### üîÑ Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Start with semantic to understand the feature
mcp__csharp-search__search_project --query "user registration"

# 2. Then use traditional to find all instances
grep -r "Register\|Registration" --include="*.cs"
```

### üéØ Query Optimization Tips

1. **Be specific**: "email validation in registration" > "validation"
2. **Use domain terms**: "loan application" not just "application"
3. **Add context**: "background job for sending emails" > "job"
4. **Filter by enhanced types**: Use auth-specific chunk types for security code

### üîó Using Cross-References in Batch Search

The cross-reference section shows files appearing in multiple queries:
- High overlap = core functionality
- Example: If the same file appears for "anti-flood", "rate limiting", and "throttling"
- Use this to identify central components quickly

### üöÄ Effective Batch Search Combinations

**For Feature Exploration:**
- Related concepts: `"login,authentication,session"`
- Technical + business: `"PDF generation,document signing,digital signature"`
- Architecture patterns: `"repository,service,controller,dependency injection"`

## Core MCP Search Tools

**Primary search tools** ‚≠ê:
- **`search_project`**: Basic semantic search with relevance scoring
- **`search_with_context`**: Extended context viewing (15-20 lines recommended)
- **`search_with_filters`**: Filter by file types and code structures
- **`batch_search`**: Multiple queries at once (3-5 queries optimal)

**Management tools**:
- **`index_project`**: Index or update projects (use `--force true` for auth detection)
- **`list_projects`**: Show all indexed projects
- **`get_project_stats`**: Memory and performance info
- **`clear_project_index`**: Remove project index

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ‚ùå Semantic Search Limitations
- May miss some results (not 100% complete)
- Requires indexing (can be outdated without re-indexing)
- Higher resource usage
- Results vary by query phrasing and model

### ‚ùå Traditional Tools Limitations
- No understanding of intent
- Can't find conceptually similar code
- No relevance ranking
- Requires exact keyword knowledge

## When to Re-index

- After adding new features (>50 files changed)
- After major refactoring
- When switching between branches with different code structures
- To enable enhanced features: use `--force true` for auth detection

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Index with meaningful names**: Use descriptive project names for multi-project solutions
2. **Adjust threshold by model**: Qwen3 (0.45+), Voyage (0.40+)
3. **Use context**: `search_with_context` with 15-20 lines for understanding
4. **Batch similar queries**: More efficient than individual searches
5. **Verify critical code**: Always double-check auth/security with traditional tools

mcp__csharp-search__search_project --project myproject --query "order processing workflow"

# Technical implementation with context
mcp__csharp-search__search_with_context --project myproject --query "caching strategy" --contextLines 20

# Authentication & security (use filters)
mcp__csharp-search__search_with_filters --project myproject --query "JWT validation" --chunkTypes "method-auth,class-auth"

# Batch exploration for architecture
mcp__csharp-search__batch_search --project myproject --queries "repository pattern,unit of work,dependency injection" --limitPerQuery 3
```

Remember: Neither tool is universally better - choose based on your specific need. When in doubt, try semantic search first for better developer experience, then verify with traditional tools if completeness is critical.
